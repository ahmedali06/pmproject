The token validation filter looks for the token in a HTTP header and then tries to validate the token using the configured
[token storage|guide:tokenStorage] implementation.

If the validation is successful, the principal object is stored in the security context. This allows you to use in
your application @\@Secured@, @springSecurityService.principal@ and so on.

{note}
@springSecurityService.currentUser@ expects a @grails.plugin.springsecurity.userdetails.GrailsUser@ to perform a DB query.
However, this plugins stores in the security context just a principal @Object@, because it does not assume you are using
domain classes to store the users. Use @springSecurityService.principal@ instead.

h2. Anonymous access

If you want to enable anonymous access to URL's where this plugin's filters are applied, you need to:

# Configure @enableAnonymousAccess = true@ (see table below).
# Make sure that the @anonymousAuthenticationFilter@ is applied before @restTokenValidationFilter@. See [how to configure filters|guide:configuration] for more details.

For example, with this configuration:

{code}
grails {
    plugin {
        springsecurity {
            filterChain {
                chainMap = [
                    '/api/guest/**': 'anonymousAuthenticationFilter,restTokenValidationFilter,restExceptionTranslationFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor',
                    '/api/**': 'JOINED_FILTERS,-anonymousAuthenticationFilter,-exceptionTranslationFilter,-authenticationProcessingFilter,-securityContextPersistenceFilter',
                    '/**': 'JOINED_FILTERS,-restTokenValidationFilter,-restExceptionTranslationFilter'
                ]
            }

            //Other Spring Security settings
            //...

            rest {
                token {
                    validation {
                        enableAnonymousAccess = true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
{code}

The following chains are configured:

# @/api/guest/\**@ is a stateless chain that allows anonymous access when no token is sent. If however a token is on the request, it will be validated.
# @/api/\**@ is a stateless chain that doesn't allow anonymous access. Thus, the token will always be required, and if missing, a Bad Request reponse will be sent back to the client.
# @/\**@ (read: everything else) is a traditional stateful chain.

h2. Validation Endpoint

There is also an endpoint available that you can call in case you want to know if a given token is valid. It looks for
the token in a HTTP header as well, and if the token is still valid, it renders [its JSON representation|guide:authentication].
If the token does not exist, it will render a @grails.plugin.springsecurity.rest.login.failureStatusCode@ response
(@401@ by default). The validation endpoint can be disabled with the corresponding option.
